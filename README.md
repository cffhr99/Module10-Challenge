# Module10-Challenge: Mission to Mars
## Overview:
Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Additional Bootstrap 3 Components:
- Adding .table-hover to enable a hover state on table rows within a <tbody>. The method is that add class" into to_html() like df.to_html(classes="table table-hover").
- Replacing the button class "btn-primary" to "btn-success", which the color becomes green.
- Adding class="col-xs-6 col-md-3" and "thumbnail" to hemisphere images to fit mobile and desktop.
